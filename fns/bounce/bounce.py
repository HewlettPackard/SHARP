"""
Bounce-back the request body.

This application reads in the entire body of the request and returns it as a 
string, together with the time it took to read the request.
This "kernel" time measures only the overhead of reading the request data 
through flask.
The complete two-way overhead of sending the request and reading it back can 
be measured as the roundtrip time from launching the function to completion.
